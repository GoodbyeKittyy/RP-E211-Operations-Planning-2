Holt's model is not suited when there is seasonality,
it is not an appropriate method for extrapolating seasonal data. 

Simple exponential smoothing : This model is good for non-seasonal data that is fairly level (no trend). 

Holt’s linear method/Double exponential smoothing : This model is good for non-seasonal data with a
trend.

the average age of the data in the simple moving average is (m+1)/2 relative to 
the period for which the forecast is computed: this is the amount of time by which 
forecasts will tend to lag behind turning points in the data. 
For example, if you are averaging the last 5 values, the forecasts will be 
about 3 periods late in responding to turning points.

T-stat. A negative sign implies that the sample mean is less than the hypothesized mean. 
This would be evidence against the null hypothesis IF (and only if) the alternative was that the true mean is LESS than the hypothesized value. 
A positive sign implies that the sample mean is larger than the hypothesized mean.
